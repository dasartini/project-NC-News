# WELCOME TO The Northcoders Times API
 I am glad that you are reading this. my first project ever made, it's a basic backend-based api that can work in any internet navigator, consisting in building an API that interacts with a PostgreSQL database using node postgress. The API has different http requests that went sent gets different responses or an error.

INSTRUCTIONS
 
To correctly connect to the provided database and run this project, it is required to create two separate files. Follow the instructions below:

1-In the root folder create a file named ".env.developement" connecting the PGDATABASE to the develpoment database in setup.sql located in the database "db" folder. 

2-In the root folder create a file named ".env.test" connecting the PGDATABASE to the test database in setup.sql located in the database "db" folder.

3- npm install dependencies.

4- run npm setup.

5 -run npm seed.

6- You are now succesfully connected to the database.

7- To run the tests locally, just type run rpm test int.

NOTE: this project was developed using Node.j v23.6.2 and PostgreSQL 14.11 therefore this would be a minimun but might not a must requirement.

To run this project in your internet navigator I will invite you to open this link:

----> https://project-nc-news-adrian-sartini.onrender.com/api

NOTE 2:It might take one minte to completely load due to the free version of server that spins down the free instance due inactivity.

You can navigate between the different methods I implemented in the app.js
Just type the endpoint at the end of the link, you can find all the endpoints in the endpoints.json file in the root folder.
example:  https://project-nc-news-adrian-sartini.onrender.com/api/articles/6
